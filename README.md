# AAR — Another Agent Runtime

AAR is a modular, secure, and extensible runtime for AI agents.  
The system focuses on control, transparency, and user-approved execution.  
Modules can access device data, perform actions, or interact with external systems —  
but never without explicit user authorization.

AAR provides:

- Controlled execution of agent actions (sandboxed modules)
- User consent and permission-based access
- Support for multiple AI backends (ChatGPT, Gemini, Ollama)
- NodeJS-based runtime
- A simple and extensible module system
- Web-based frontend for interaction and approval
- Device identification, optional 2FA, and full audit logging

---

## Features

### Modular architecture
- Modules are plain `.js` files.
- Each module defines:
  - ID and name  
  - Capabilities (READ / READ_WRITE)
  - Commands
  - Handler functions
- Modules can only run after explicit user approval.

### Security-first design
- User approval required for module activation
- Optional WebAuthn device binding
- Optional 2FA (TOTP or WebAuthn)
- Granular, module-level permissions
- Full audit log of module usage and agent actions

### Pluggable AI backends
AAR supports multiple model providers via adapters:

- OpenAI / ChatGPT
- Google Gemini
- Ollama (local LLMs)

Adapters implement a unified interface and can be extended easily.

### Web-based frontend
- Real-time approval pop-ups
- Module overview and permissions control
- Command console (`/run ...`)
- System status and logs

### Simple module development
Example module:

```js
module.exports = {
  id: "time",
  name: "Time Module",
  capabilities: ["READ"],

  commands: {
    getTime: {
      description: "Returns the current time",
      handler: async () => new Date().toLocaleTimeString()
    },
    getDate: {
      description: "Returns the current date",
      handler: async () => new Date().toLocaleDateString()
    }
  }
};
```

Command System

AAR provides a structured command interface accessible via the frontend or API.

List all modules and information about the Modules

> /run module list

Example output:

getTime
getDate
getMonth

Run a module command

> /run module time getTime

If the module has not been authorized yet, the frontend prompts the user for approval.


---

Permission Model

Modules declare capabilities:

READ – Module can only read or fetch data

READ_WRITE – Module can perform actions or modify states


AAR enforces:

User approval before the module can execute

Optional per-command or per-session approvals

Revocation of permissions at any time

Full audit logs for every action



Goals

AAR aims to provide a transparent, controlled, and extensible runtime for AI agents.
The system is designed to integrate safely with devices, data sources, and external tools,
with the user always remaining in full control.

Future Extensions (Planned)

- Role-based permission presets
- Enhanced sandboxing through isolated workers
- container builds
